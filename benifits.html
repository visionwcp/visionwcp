      <p class="space-b space-t center-b">Clean windows have many benefits, ranging from your building's overall appearance to improving the efficiency of your home.</p>
      <h3 class="space-b center border-b">Appearance</h3>
        <p class="space-b center-b">A regular maintenance routine should include window cleaning, and it is best if windows are cleaned at least once a month. Clean windows make both the exterior and interior of a building more appealing. For a home, clean windows will make the house look well-maintained and cared for. For a business, clean windows indicate that the owner is conscientious and will take care of even the smallest details. This can be very enticing for customers. The interior of a home will look clean and tidy when smudges and dirt have been removed from glass. Sunlight will be able to stream through the﻿ windows﻿ without shadows being cast from water deposits or fingerprints. Shiny windows will also invite guests to sit back and enjoy the warm and cozy environment. The interior of a business environment will also benefit from clean windows. Products and displays can be seen more clearly by consumers, which will encourage them to visit the shop.</p>
      <h3 class="space-b center border-b">Maintain Quality of Windows</h3>
        <p class="space-b center-b">By performing regular window cleaning tasks, you ensure that your windows will have a long life. Many environmental contaminants, such as acid rain, hard water and oxidation, can damage windows over time. When you regularly clean your windows, you remove the materials that could cause the glass to break down or become weaker. You will be less likely to need glass restoration in the future, which will save you quite a bit of money.</p>
      <h3 class="space-b center border-b">Efficiency and Effectiveness</h3>
        <p class="space-b center-b">Windows are more efficient when they are cleaned properly. Dirt and grime can prevent sunlight from warming the house naturally during winter. Insects can eat through window screens and have access to the interior of the building. Dirt and dead bugs can accumulate in the sill of the window, which may prevent the window from sealing correctly. Oxidation and weathering of frames can cause minor air or water leaks. These leaks could cause fogging and condensation on the inside of the windows and may lead to mold or mildew on the windows. All of these problems keep your windows from being as effective as possible. When you clean them thoroughly, you remove the materials that could interfere with how well your windows insulate and protect your home.</p>
      <h3 class="space-b center border-b">Comfort</h3>
        <p class="space-b center-b">When you have clean windows, you are able to be more comfortable in your home or office. You will not be distracted by the smudges or grime that accumulates on the glass, and you will be able to thoroughly enjoy the view from your windows. Clean windows allow you to bask in warm sunlight without worrying about all of the spots or smears that can interfere. You won’t feel embarrassed when visitors or customers stop by because you will know that your windows are as shiny as possible. Clean, shiny windows contribute to an atmosphere that is tidy and inviting.</p>
